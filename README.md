# Code-Challenge-2018-UPE
this is my python code for UPE code challenge 2018.
The screenshot is a proof of success (the final status is FINISHED)
I used Visual Studio to write this piece of code
For convenience of debugging, I printed out the status in each level and the current-location in each step of recursion.
